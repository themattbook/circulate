# Circulate
Circulate is an open source network where users can create, like, and share content.

## Open Source. Easy.
The aim of Circulate is to provide an open source, easy-to-use social media platform that can be deployed by individuals with little technical knowledge. There's a lot to do starting out, but this project will also see frequent updates and become more sophisticated over time. New features will be planned and implemented.
