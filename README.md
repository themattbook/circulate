# Circulate

Circulate is an open source network where users can create, like, and share content.

## Open Source. Easy.

The aim of Circulate is to provide an open source, easy-to-use social media platform that can be deployed by individuals with little technical knowledge. There's a lot to do starting out, but this project will also see frequent updates and become more sophisticated over time. New features will be planned and implemented.

## Development

To get started, clone the repository. You'll have 2 folders within the main Circulate directory; Client and Server. Go into the both Client and Server folders and run `npm install` - this will install all of the necessary packages required.

Once installed, you can start the Vue frontend by going back into the Client folder and running:
`npm run serve`

To start the backend, navigate into the server folder and running:
`npm run dev`

At the time of writing, there is no viable information in the backend to send to the Vue client. This will change as development continues.
